      <h2>Welcome to Kerala Tourism</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Kerala, located on the south-western tip of India, enjoys unique
        geographical features that have made it one of the most sought-after
        tourist destinations in Asia. Fondly referred to as ‘God’s Own Country’,
        Kerala was selected by the National Geographic Traveller as one of the
        50 destinations of a lifetime and one of the thirteen paradises in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        An equable climate, serene beaches, tranquil stretches of backwaters,
        lush hill stations and exotic wildlife are the major attractions of this
        land. A unique advantage of Kerala is that most of the destinations here
        are only a two - four hour drive from the other.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Classical art forms, colourful festivals, exotic cuisine are some of the
        cultural marvels that await travellers. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian
        system of medicine and Panchakarma, the rejuvenation therapy in Ayurveda
        have also helped Kerala to gain a pan-global reputation as a worth-visit
        destination.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Season never ends in Kerala, thanks to the year-long moderate climate
        and numerous festivals and events.

      <h2>5 Tourist Attractions in Kerala that you must visit</h2>
      <hr />
      <p class="text-areas-to-visit">
        <strong>Alappuzha</strong> (Alleppey) is known as ‘the Venice of the
        East’. Offering the best tourist places in Alleppey, this charming place
        is the hub of Kerala’s backwaters and is home to a huge network of
        backwaters and more than thousand houseboats. The houseboats you find in
        the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the
        Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’,
        means living structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days,
        kettuvallam or boat with a thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls
        was used to carry tons of rice and spices.

        <strong>Thiruvananthapuram,</strong>
        otherwise known as Trivandrum, this city is the capital and presumably
        the most culturally affluent part of the state. Trivandrum has played
        host to a variety of rulers who have all left behind a mark over the
        city. Rapid development has not hindered the unique heritage in the form
        of the architecture and the culture that is still embodied by the city.
        The Kowdiar Palace, which was previously the official residence of the
        Travancore royal family, is particularly a must-visit in the city.
